The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:
1.It must start with a hashtag (`#`).
2.All words must have their first letter capitalized.
3.If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return `false`.
4.If the input or the result is an empty string it must return `false`.
