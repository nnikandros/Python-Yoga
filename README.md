# Python Yoga

This repository is a collection of exercises and solutions for Python of various levels. In all cases I have solved them myself before posting a solution. In some cases
I have also added solutions of other people that I found to be instructive or "better" than mine.

Currently there are two subfolders. One folder for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and one folder for [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.come)
